## Shell & Commands (Windows PowerShell)
- **Command Chaining:** When running multiple commands in a single `run_shell_command` call, use the semicolon `;` as a separator instead of `&&`. 
    - *Correct:* `git status; git log`
    - *Incorrect:* `git status && git log` (Causes a ParserError in PowerShell).
- **File Operations:** Prefer PowerShell syntax for operations like copying files during builds:
    - `powershell -Command "Copy-Item -Path 'public/*' -Destination 'dist' -Recurse -Force"`

## General rules

Always take the chunks we have worked on and break them into logical git commits

Always attempt to build anything that needs to be built
